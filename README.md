### Hi there, I'm Irwin!

 I'm still finding my niche. I have a tendency to explore different programming languages. I love problem-solving, and translating my solutions and ideas into code. I've had a run with coding since around 2017. During this time I've experimented a tad bit with HTML, CSS, 
 JavaScript, Java, C++, Dart, and C#, amongst others. But I'm more of a generalist.  

🌱 I've taken a new interest in application development on the .NET platform, so I'm currently learning C#.

🔭 I'm currently not working on any project. Although, you could check out my last project - a Ludo game. It's on my repo.

My interests, besides coding, include trading and technical analysis, listening to music, watching animations, gaming, and pretty much anything else I find interesting.

📫 You can reach me by email at [developer.irwin@gmail.com](mailto:developer.irwin@gmail.com)

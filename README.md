### Hi there, I'm Irwin (AKA Clairvoyance)

 I'm still finding my niche. I have a tendency to explore different programming languages. I love problem-solving, and translating my solutions and ideas into code. I've had a run with coding since around 2017. During this time I've experimented a tad bit with HTML, CSS, 
 JavaScript, Java, C++, Dart, and C#, amongst others. But I'm more of a generalist.  

ðŸŒ± I've taken a new interest in application development on the .NET platform, so I'm currently learning C#.

ðŸ”­ I'm currently not working on any project. Although, you could check out my last project - a Ludo game. It's on my repo.

My other interests, besides coding, include music, animation movies, series, and pretty much anything I  
find interesting.

ðŸ“« You can reach me by email at [developer.irwin@gmail.com](mailto:developer.irwin@gmail.com)
